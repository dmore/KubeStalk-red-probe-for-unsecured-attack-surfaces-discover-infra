# KubeStalk
KubeStalk is a tool to discover Kubernetes and related infrastructure based attack surface from a black-box perspective. This tool is a community version of the tool used to probe for unsecured Kubernetes clusters around the internet during [Project Resonance - Wave 9](https://redhuntlabs.com/blog/unsecured-kubernetes-clusters-exposed/).

## Usage
The GIF below demonstrates usage of the tool:

### Installation
KubeStalk is written in Python and requires the `requests` library.

To install the tool, you can clone the repository to any directory:
```
git clone https://github.com/redhuntlabs/kubestalk
```
Once cloned, you need to install the `requests` library using `python3 -m pip install requests` or:
```
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Everything is setup and you can use the tool directly.

### Command-line Arguments
A list of command line arguments supported by the tool can be displayed using the `-h` flag.
```s
$ python3 kubestalk.py  -h

usage: ./kubestalk.py <url(s)>/<cidr>

Required Arguments:
  urls                  List of hosts to scan

Optional Arguments:
  -o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT
                        Output path to write the CSV file to
  -f SIG_FILE, --sig-dir SIG_FILE
                        Signature directory path to load
  -t TIMEOUT, --timeout TIMEOUT
                        HTTP timeout value in seconds
  -ua USER_AGENT, --user-agent USER_AGENT
                        User agent header to set in HTTP requests
  --concurrency CONCURRENCY
                        No. of hosts to process simultaneously
  --verify-ssl          Verify SSL certificates
  --version             Display the version of KubeStalk and exit.
```

#### Basic Usage
To use the tool, you can pass one or more hosts to the script. All targets passed to the tool must be [RFC 3986](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986) complaint, i.e. must contain a scheme and hostname (and port if required).

A basic usage is as below:
```
$ python3 kubestalk.py https://███.██.██.███:10250

[+] Loaded 10 signatures to scan.
[*] Processing host: https://███.██.██.██:10250
[!] Found potential issue on https://███.██.██.██:10250: Kubernetes Pod List Exposure
[*] Writing results to output file.
[+] Done.
```

#### HTTP Tuning
HTTP requests can be fine-tuned using the `-t` (to mention HTTP timeouts), `-ua` (to specify custom user agents) and the `--verify-ssl` (to validate SSL certificates while making requests).

#### Concurrency
You can control the number of hosts to scan simultanously using the `--concurrency` flag. The default value is set to 5.

#### Output
The output is written to a CSV filea and can be controlled by the `--output` flag.

A sample of the CSV output rendered in markdown is as belows:

|host                       |path |issue                       |type          |severity                      |
